<h1><b>Desktop Assistant</b></h1>
<br>
<p>In this project I have automated some of my regular tasks using python. This desktop Assistant contains some of the
 task being automated which are hard coded in program. It will greet you according to your time zone,will ask for task, 
and continue with it. You can stop the program by just saying 'Quit' or 'Exit'. In case if it does not recognize what you said,
it would again ask you to say that again.</p>
